### Homework Mighty Thymio

This homework is about simulating Mighty Thymio in Coppelia Simulator by using Ros2.
Our solution implements three different tasks:
  - **Task 1**: Open-loop controller that moves the MyT in such a way that it follows an "8" trajectory.
  - **Task 2**: Controller that makes MyT moves straight ahead until it is close to the wall (without hitting the wall), then turns in place in such a way to face the wall as precisely as possible.
  - **Task 3**: Upgrade of controller made in task 2. Once the MyT arrives close to the wall, it turns in such a way that it is facing opposite to the wall, then move and stop in such a way that the robot is as close as possible to a point that is 2 meters away from the wall
  - **Bonus Task 1**: Controller that randomly explores an environment, avoiding any obstacles (similar to what a Roomba would do).
